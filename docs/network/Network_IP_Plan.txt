# Network IP Plan – Lab Environment

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the IP addressing design for the Infrastructure/Security lab.
The goal is to maintain consistent addressing for troubleshooting, service deployment,
and future expansion (AD, DNS, DHCP).

---

## 2. Network Overview

### 2.1 NAT Network
- Purpose: Internet access (updates, downloads)
- Managed by: VirtualBox NAT
- Not used for internal services

### 2.2 Host-only Network
- Subnet: 192.168.56.0/24
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Purpose: Internal lab LAN (VM ↔ VM communication)

## 3. Address Allocation Plan

### 3.1 Reserved Addresses

192.168.56.1 – Host-only adapter (VirtualBox)
192.168.56.10–19 – Reserved for servers
192.168.56.20–99 – Client range
192.168.56.100–200 – Future expansion / testing

---

## 4. Current VM Assignment

| Machine | Role | Interface | IP Address | Type |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|------|
| WS01 | Windows Server | Host-only | 192.168.56.10 | Static |
| CL01 | Windows Client | Host-only | 192.168.56.20 | Static |
| LNX01 | Linux Client | Host-only | 192.168.56.30 | Static |

## 5. DNS Strategy

Current State:
- No internal DNS deployed yet.

Planned:
- WS01 will host internal DNS service.
- All clients will use 192.168.56.10 as primary DNS.

---

## 6. DHCP Strategy

Current State:
- IP addresses manually configured (static).

Planned:
- DHCP service may be deployed on WS01 in later phase.
- Planned DHCP scope: 192.168.56.50–100

---

## 7. Design Rationale

- Static IP used for server stability.
- Host-only network isolates internal lab traffic.
- NAT interface reserved for Internet access only.
- IP ranges separated for easier troubleshooting and scaling.

---

## 8. Future Expansion

Potential additional VMs:
- DC01 (Domain Controller) – 192.168.56.11
- FS01 (File Server) – 192.168.56.12
- Security Testing VM – 192.168.56.50+
