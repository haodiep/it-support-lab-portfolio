# Issue: Linux ping Windows fails (ICMP blocked)

## Environment:
Same subnet (192.168.56.0/24)
Linux client (LNX01)
Windows client/server (CL01 / WS01)

## SYMPTOMS
From Linux: ping <Windows_IP> → 100% packet loss
From Windows: ping <Linux_IP> → success
IP address correct
Same host-only network

## ROOT CAUSE
Windows Defender Firewall blocks inbound ICMP (Echo Request).

## FIX (PowerShell - Run as Administrator)
Enable ICMP inbound rule:
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)"

## VALIDATION
From Linux:
ping -c 3 <Windows_IP>

## Expected result:
0% packet loss
Ping reply received

### Optional:
Verify in Wireshark with filter:
icmp

## ROLLBACK (if needed)
Disable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)"
